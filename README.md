# Electricity AI Analysis

Streamlit dashboard to visualize electricity usage vs. price trends with AI forecasting.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to leverage Python, data science, and AI to analyze and forecast real-world problemsâ€”in this case, the relationship between electricity consumption and energy costs over time. I designed and built a full end-to-end analytics pipeline with a deployable dashboard, showcasing skills that translate directly to business value in a technology organization.

ðŸ”‘ Highlights

Data Engineering & Preprocessing

Automated pipelines in Python (pandas, numpy) to clean, merge, and generate synthetic datasets for electricity usage and price trends.

Designed scripts that can self-heal (auto-generate data if missing) for reliable deployment.

Machine Learning & Forecasting

Built lightweight AI models with scikit-learn to forecast electricity usage, prices, and daily costs.

Implemented an auto-training workflow, ensuring models are retrained when new data is available.

Interactive Visualization

Developed a Streamlit dashboard for real-time visualization of trends and forecasts.

Integrated line charts, forecasts, and cost analysis for actionable insights.

Deployment Ready

Packaged the project with a clean repository structure, requirements.txt, and automated scripts.

Cloud-deployable via Streamlit Cloud, making the tool accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Snapshots

This project uses Python, Streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn, and Altair to analyze electricity usage vs. rising costs and provide AI-powered forecasts. Below are snapshots of the interactive dashboard, highlighting different features.

âš¡ Electricity Usage Over Time


Daily electricity consumption (kWh) across two years.

Demonstrates time series visualization.

Highlights data preprocessing and feature engineering with pandas.

ðŸ’° Electricity Price Over Time


Trend of electricity prices ($/kWh).

Shows cost inflation over time.

Illustrates integration of multiple datasets into a single pipeline.

ðŸ“‰ Daily Cost (Usage Ã— Price)


Daily household/business cost of electricity usage.

Combines consumption and pricing to create business-ready insights.

Demonstrates ability to transform raw data into decision-making metrics.

ðŸ”® AI Forecasts (Next 90 Days)


Forecasted usage, prices, and daily costs using scikit-learn regression models.

Proves skills in machine learning for time series forecasting.

Shows how predictive analytics can reduce business risk.

ðŸ“… Seasonality Analysis (Grouped Bar Chart)


Average monthly usage vs. cost, visualized in grouped bars.

Reveals seasonal consumption patterns (e.g., summer peaks).

Highlights business implications like budgeting for seasonal costs.

ðŸŽ› Interactive Altair Chart (Usage vs. Cost by Month)


Interactive chart with tooltips. Hover over bars to see exact values.

Demonstrates advanced data visualization using Altair.

Recruiter takeaway: shows ability to make insights user-friendly and interactive.

ðŸ“¥ Downloadable Insights

The dashboard allows exporting seasonality data as a CSV, showing practical product thinking:

Users (or stakeholders) can take results offline for reporting.

Demonstrates how I bridge analytics and usability.
