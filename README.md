# Electricity AI Analysis

Streamlit dashboard to visualize electricity usage vs. price trends with AI forecasting.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to leverage Python, data science, and AI to analyze and forecast real-world problemsâ€”in this case, the relationship between electricity consumption and energy costs over time. I designed and built a full end-to-end analytics pipeline with a deployable dashboard, showcasing skills that translate directly to business value in a technology organization.

ðŸ”‘ Highlights

Data Engineering & Preprocessing

Automated pipelines in Python (pandas, numpy) to clean, merge, and generate synthetic datasets for electricity usage and price trends.

Designed scripts that can self-heal (auto-generate data if missing) for reliable deployment.

Machine Learning & Forecasting

Built lightweight AI models with scikit-learn to forecast electricity usage, prices, and daily costs.

Implemented an auto-training workflow, ensuring models are retrained when new data is available.

Interactive Visualization

Developed a Streamlit dashboard for real-time visualization of trends and forecasts.

Integrated line charts, forecasts, and cost analysis for actionable insights.

Deployment Ready

Packaged the project with a clean repository structure, requirements.txt, and automated scripts.

Cloud-deployable via Streamlit Cloud, making the tool accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
